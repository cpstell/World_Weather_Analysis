# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a map that allows users to enter weather criteria and find potential travel destinations. This is performed by utilizing Google API's and OpenWeather. The resulting search outputs hotel name, country, weather conditions, and a brief description. The final step was to setup a driving itinerary for four locations the user would like to drive to within the same country and/or continent.
